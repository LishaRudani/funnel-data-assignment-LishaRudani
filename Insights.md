Actionable Insights
- Mobile drop-off at Interact → Clicks is significantly higher than on desktop. Merchants should simplify mobile navigation and add contextual nudges (e.g., product highlights, quicker CTA buttons) to reduce friction.  
- Intent “pricing” and “discount” queries show the strongest correlation with purchase. Merchants can surface personalized offers or bundle deals when these intents are detected.  
- High violation rate in cancellation SLA suggests delays in processing cancellations. Streamlining cancellation workflows or introducing a self-serve cancellation option could reduce SLA breaches.  
- Unknown intents form a sizeable share of customer messages. Improving intent detection (e.g., retraining NLP models with recent queries) will help reduce “unknown” cases and enable better automation.  
- Repeat clicks without purchase are noticeable for certain devices. Merchants could investigate checkout UX (payment methods, loading time) to identify blockers.  

Experiment Proposal
- Experiment: A/B test a simplified mobile checkout flow that removes one step (e.g., auto-filling saved addresses or skipping optional forms).  
- Success Metric: Increase in conversion rate (Clicks → Purchase) on mobile by at least +5% within two weeks, measured against the control group.
